      "The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.",
      "Bitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak.",
      "The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way.",
      "It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.",
      "Bitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency.",
      "Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes.",
      "Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.",
      "Being the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, and so on.",
      "The cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by Ethereum which led to the development of other amazing projects such as EOS, Tron, and even crypto-collectibles such as CryptoKitties."

      "Ripple is the catchall name for the cryptocurrency platform, the transactional protocol for which is actually XRP, in the same fashion as Ethereum is the name for the platform that facilitates trades in Ether.",
      "Like other cryptocurrencies, Ripple is built atop the idea of a distributed ledger network which requires various parties to participate in validating transactions, rather than any singular centralized authority.",
      "That facilitates transactions all over the world, and transfer fees are far cheaper than the likes of bitcoin.",
      "Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP transfers are effectively immediate, requiring no typical confirmation time.",
      "Ripple was originally founded by a single company, Ripple Labs, and continues to be backed by it, rather than the larger network of developers that continue bitcoin’s development.",
      "It also doesn’t have a fluctuating amount of its currency in existence.",
      "Where bitcoin has a continually growing pool with an eventual maximum, and Ethereum theoretically has no limit, Ripple was created with all of its 100 billion XRP tokens right out of the gate.",
      "That number is maintained with no mining and most of the tokens are owned and held by Ripple Labs itself — around 60 billion at the latest count.",
      "Even at the recently reduced value of around half a dollar per XRP, that means Ripple Labs is currently sitting on around $20 billion worth of the cryptocurrency (note: Ripple’s price crashed hard recently, and may be worth far less than $60 billion by time you read this).",
      "It holds 55 billion XRP in an escrow account, which allows it to sell up to a billion per month if it so chooses in order to fund new projects and acquisitions.",
      "Selling such an amount would likely have a drastic effect on the cryptocurrency’s value, and isn’t something Ripple Labs plans to do anytime soon.",
      "In actuality, Ripple Labs is looking to leverage the technology behind XRP to allow for faster banking transactions around the world.",
      "While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on the idea of separating financial transactions from the financial organizations of traditional currencies, Ripple is almost the opposite in every sense.",
